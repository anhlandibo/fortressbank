mkdir -p secrets

# Deploy with production overlay
docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.base.yml \
  -f docker-compose.infra.yml \
  -f docker-compose.services.yml \
  -f docker-compose.prod.yml \
  --env-file .env.prod \
  up -d

# Verify deployment
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100
```

### 10.3 Keycloak Realm Update

```bash
# Apply production security settings to Keycloak realm
# Option 1: Via Admin Console - import production-security-overlay.json
# Option 2: Via Admin REST API

KEYCLOAK_URL="https://auth.yourdomain.com"
ADMIN_TOKEN="your_admin_token"

curl -X PUT "${KEYCLOAK_URL}/admin/realms/fortressbank-realm" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ADMIN_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @keycloak/realms/production-security-overlay.json

### 10.4 Health Check Verification

```bash
# Check all services are healthy
for service in kong user-service account-service transaction-service; do
