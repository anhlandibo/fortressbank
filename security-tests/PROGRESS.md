## Test Execution Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# 1. Ensure FortressBank is running
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Navigate to security tests
cd security-tests

# 3. Get authentication token
cd utils
./keycloak-auth.sh testuser password123
source /tmp/fortressbank-tokens.sh
cd ..
```

### Run All Tests (Recommended)
```bash
# One command to rule them all
./run-all-tests.sh
```

### Run Individual Category Tests
```bash
# JWT attacks
cd 1-jwt-attacks && ./none-algorithm-attack.sh && cd ..

# Authorization tests
cd 2-authorization-attacks && ./account-idor-test.sh && cd ..

# Fraud evasion
cd 3-fraud-evasion && ./salami-slicing-attack.sh && cd ..

# Input validation
cd 4-input-validation && ./soap-xxe-attack.sh && cd ..

# API gateway
cd 5-api-gateway && ./header-injection-test.sh && cd ..
```

## What's Been Built

### Total Files Created: 24
- 6 documentation files (5 READMEs + EXPLAIN-LIKE-IM-FIVE.md)
- 2 utility scripts (jwt-tool.py + keycloak-auth.sh)
- 16 penetration test scripts
- 1 master test runner (run-all-tests.sh)

### Lines of Code: ~5,800+
- Python: ~400 lines (jwt-tool.py)
- Bash: ~5,100 lines (test scripts + runner)
- Markdown: ~1,800 lines (documentation + guide)

### Attack Vectors Covered: 16
1. JWT 'none' algorithm bypass
2. Token replay after logout
3. Expired token validation
4. JWT claim modification
5. IDOR (horizontal privilege escalation)
6. RBAC bypass (vertical privilege escalation)
7. Cross-tenant fund transfer
8. Salami slicing (cumulative amount bypass)
9. Transaction velocity bypass
10. Negative amount exploit
11. SOAP XXE injection
12. Oversized payload DoS
13. SQL/XSS/command injection
14. HTTP header manipulation
15. Rate limiting bypass
16. Backend network segmentation

## Security Findings Already Identified

### 🔴 Critical Issues Found (Code Analysis)

1. **JwtConfig.java Line 44 Bug**
   - Uses `issuerUri` instead of `jwkSetUri`
   - May cause JWT validation failures
   
2. **SecurityConfig.java: `.anyRequest().permitAll()`**
   - Backend trusts Kong headers without validation
   - Risk: Header injection if Kong bypassed

3. **RiskEngineService: Static Threshold**
   - `HIGH_AMOUNT_THRESHOLD = 10000.0`
   - No cumulative tracking detected
   - Vulnerable to salami slicing

4. **Kong: No Rate Limiting on Main Branch**
   - Config analysis shows no rate-limiting plugin
   - Vulnerable to velocity attacks

## Test Execution Status

| Category | Tests | Status |

| JWT Attacks | 4 | ✅ Ready to run |
| Authorization | 3 | ✅ Ready to run |
| Fraud Evasion | 3 | ✅ Ready to run |

## Architecture Philosophy

These tests are **architecture-agnostic**:
- ✅ Work regardless of Smart OTP branch status
- ✅ Independent of product team decisions
- ✅ Test security fundamentals, not implementation details
- ✅ Provide value even if main branch has violations

As the security team: "I don't give a shit they do right or wrong, let's keep being better and do more as long as we are not deeply involved in their work"

## How to Use This Work

### For Security Audits
```bash
# Run all tests and capture output
./run-all-tests.sh
# Report saved to: test-results-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt
```

### For CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-tests.yml
- name: Run Security Tests
  run: |
    cd security-tests
    export ACCESS_TOKEN=${{ secrets.KEYCLOAK_TOKEN }}
    ./run-all-tests.sh
    
- name: Upload Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: security-test-results
    path: security-tests/test-results-*.txt
```

### For Learning
```bash
# Read the beginner's guide
cat EXPLAIN-LIKE-IM-FIVE.md

# Try one attack manually
cd 1-jwt-attacks
cat README.md  # Understand the theory
./none-algorithm-attack.sh  # See it in action
```

### For Reporting
Each test outputs:
- ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL status
- Security level assessment
- Detailed remediation guidance
- Code examples for fixes

Master runner generates:
- Timestamped result files
